## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please:

    - Steps to reproduce the issue.
    - Expected and actual behavior.
    - Any relevant logs or screenshots.
    - Environment details (e.g., OS, browser, version of the software).

If your issue is a **feature request**, please include:

## Submitting Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request (PR), please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch from `main` for your work. Use a descriptive name, such as `feat/adding-new-providers`.

### Commit Message Format

At the top level, we use the following types to categorize our commits:

- `feat`: New feature that adds functionality. These are automatically added to the changelog when creating new releases.
- `fix`: A fix to an existing feature. These are automatically added to the changelog when creating new releases.
- `docs`: Changes to documentation only. These do not appear in the changelog.
- `chore`: Changes to code that are neither a fix nor a feature (e.g., refactoring, adding tests, etc.). These do not appear in the changelog.
